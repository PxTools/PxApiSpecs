# Notes from meeting SCB SSB 2022-11-01
- We will use of UTC time for date times in the API responses. 
- We will add a possible setting for the API, where one can specify the tome zone if the setting is missing the server time zone will be used. The time zone should be exposed by the config endpoint.
- Feedback about the partial classes and generation of a Class Library. One cannot generate partial classes when generating a Class  Library, so the question is should we generate a Class Library. We should investigate a workflow option when not generating a Class Library.
- PR 31 investigate if values could be on the abstractvariable since the value collection on the ContentsVariabe should be an array of - ContentValue maybe adding a values array of Value on the TimeVariable is the write solution.
- Only have one array with all variables. The Order of the variables should be:
    1. Contents
    2. Time
    3. Geographical
    4. Mandatory
    5. The remaining variables
We should also a SortCode property on the variables according to the original order in the data source.
- SortCode will be in Folder schema although it will not be set to anything in the first version. Instead, the document order will be the sort order according to the data source.
- We should add task able items from the meeting notes as issues on GitHub.
